“The system follows this pipeline:

Contract upload

Text extraction

Contract domain classification

Planning module selects agents

Specialized AI agents analyze the contract

A consensus agent produces a final verdict

A structured downloadable report is generated”

“LangGraph is used to validate and orchestrate this inter-agent flow.”


#Architecture of Multi-turn interaction between agents
Round 1:
Legal → JSON
Compliance → JSON
Finance → JSON
Operations → JSON

Round 2 (NEW):
Each agent receives:
- Its own output
- Other agents’ summaries
→ Produces a refined response

Final:
Consensus uses refined outputs
